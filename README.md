# puribvlicate
Service-agnostic profile association using profile picture, birth date, location, and more!

Puribvlicate (an anagram of 'public private'), scans many sites that expose user profile information to the public or to other users of free services, and attempts to match a given profile url to the same user on other websites based on the username, profile picture, location, description, birth date, or even the title (and sometimes also the contents) of forum posts or comments.

Proof of Concept pending PR!
